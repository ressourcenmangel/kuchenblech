## Kuchenblech deployment

A big part of this setup is about how we work with the *Kuchenblech* theme. Its open-source repository is maintained by our [ressourcenmangel organization on GitHub](https://github.com/ressourcenmangel).

You can use the *Kesselblech* theme in the *Kuchenblech* boilerplate with the related [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rsm/kuchenblech). If you want to contribute and use the new version in this repository, you have to commit your changes to the GitHub repository and publish it with a new version tag on [**npm**](https://www.npmjs.com).

1. Commit your changes with a [proper commit message](#commits) to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ressourcenmangel/kuchenblech)
2. Create a version commit:
    * Add your changes to the [changelog](#changelog)
    * Update the version number in `package.json` and the changelog.
    * Commit message: "ðŸ”– Version X.X.X"
3. Add a tag with version to this commit ("X.X.X")
4. Push to master branch (make sure to push all tags!)
5. Publish on **npm**
    * Run `npm login` and fill in your login data from your **npm** account (make sure you have the rights to publish in the *@rsm* namespace)
    * Run `npm publish`
